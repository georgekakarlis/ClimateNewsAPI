# Climate News API

It is my actual first time to build such a good API - Web scraping with Nodejs. 

The code is documented so beginners may not have problem understanding it. 

The api backend relies in https://climate-changeapp.herokuapp.com/ 
and also in RapidHUB : https://rapidapi.com/georgekakarlis/api/climatechangenewsapi3
